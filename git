* What is git?

- Runs on the command line

If you mkae a code change that you realize later on was a huge mistake, you can revert back to an older version of that file.

- A version control system

Git also makes working on a team a lot easier. Each developer can work on a copy of the project on their own computer. This copy is stored in a folder connected to git, which is called a local repository. The developers can then send their code changes up to the main remote repository which is stored online, and get code changes made by other developers.
